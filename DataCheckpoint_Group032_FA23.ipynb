    "Job postings provide key information about an open job position to serve the purpose of recruiting new employees. From a job seeker’s perspective, the job posting creates the first impression of the employer and serves a crucial role in judging potential company fit. Based on content, structure, tone, and length, job seekers can form assumptions about a company’s work culture, values, management, and other aspects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that job seekers make speculations about a company from the job posting, our team was interested in discovering whether these speculations have any statistical basis. As undergraduate students who read many job postings in our search for work, we were most interested in the element of tone. According to LinkedIn Talent Solutions, applicants are 2-4x less likely to apply for a job posting with a tone that doesn't match the perceived company culture [1]. If the tone of a job posting is not genuinely reflective of satisfaction within a company, then job seekers should adjust their perception to account for these insights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using existing data, we aim to determine if there is a statistical relationship between the degree of neutrality and subjectivity expressed in job postings and the overall satisfaction of employees working at the company. This research focuses on “Data Analyst/Scientist” positions, as they closely align with the interests of the research team. To collect data on job postings, we use existing raw datasets scraped from Glassdoor found on Kaggle. For the neutrality and subjectivity analysis, we use Vader to determine the degree of neutrality and TextBlob to analyze subjectivity [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to data collection and analysis, we conducted a literature review of past studies to gain a better understanding of research on the relationship between job postings, company performance, and public perception. \n",
    "\n",
    "A study conducted by Stanford University [3], converted qualitative reviews into quantitative metrics and used them to predict the corresponding ratings on Glassdoor. The research findings indicated that their model had a 46.4% accuracy in using the sentiment of a review to predict the ratings on a scale from 1 to 5 stars. While our study will be conducted through a different method, the conclusion from this existing study serves as a reference for our study outcome, and further comparison and analysis could be done based on both conclusions. Another study looked into how the tone of job postings affects applicants’ impression of the employers and likelihood to apply [4]. The study concluded that job postings with a generic tone are more likely to attract applicants than those with a formal or casual tone, which implies that the tone of the job posting is directly related to applicants’ impressions of the position and employer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our existing knowledge and experience in analyzing job postings and the available literature, we hypothesize that within our proposed research scope, there will be a correlation between the degree of neutrality and the degree of subjectivity of the job postings, and the overall company rating. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Dataset #1** is a valuable resource for individuals looking for data analyst positions, especially amidst the aftermath of the pandemic. The dataset includes information on the job title (mostly data analyst jobs), the glassdoor salary estimate (mostly between $41K-$78K) , the job description, the company name and rating, the company headquarter’s location (majority from New York and Chicago), the size of the company by number of employees, and the year the company was founded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset #2** contains detailed information related to data science job postings from Glassdoor.com allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the data science job market. The breakdown of the key columns and their majority is as follows: 29% data scientist jobs, remote location of the job, 1001-10000 plus company size by employees, 42% private companies and 33% public companies. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset #3** contains similar content to the previous datasets providing more valuable information to fill in the gaps. This dataset’s majority of information is on data scientist and data engineer jobs, companies in New York and San Francisco, company size of 501-1000 and 1001-5000 employees, with 55% private companies and 26% public companies. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal dataset for job postings would include the job type, the description, the rating of the overall company, the name of the company, the size of the company,  the location of the company, the degree of subjectivity, and the degree of neutrality on the description. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of observations, 500 rows of datasets would be reasonable since it is enough to get a clear correlation between our desired variables. These data columns, except the tone of the description and degree of subjectivity, would be obtained from the existing datasets. Metrics on the neutrality of the posting description would be generated by using a sentiment analysis package called VADER in Python while the subjectivity would be generated by using a TextBlob package. All this data would finally be incorporated into a new dataset structured via the data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three real datasets all have almost everything we need and all of them contain many extra information, such as the salary estimate, and the revenue. This would be fine as we could reach our desired data through the cleaning process by removing unnecessary columns and get our degree of neutrality and degree of subjectivity by performing the algorithms embedded in Python; thus, we could finally merge all these three datasets into one big dataset by having no duplicated companies in the dataset.\n"

The dataset includes job postings from Glassdoor, which were directly scraped from the Glassdoor website and do not include any sensitive information about the company, the job position, or personal information about the reviewers. \n",

    "According to Glassdoor, the aggregate company rating is determined using user-submitted reviews: “Company ratings on Glassdoor are determined by recent employee feedback. Glassdoor calculates company ratings using a proprietary rating algorithm, with an emphasis on the recency of reviews” [5].\n",

    "\n",
    "Our use of the sentiment analysis algorithm embedded in Python to determine the sentiment of job postings introduces ethical considerations. The model may have biases or inaccuracies in detecting sentiments and since we cannot really know how the code in this model was written, its inaccuracies are a limitation of our research. Even though we could manually alter some critical factors in the model, it would be still worth considering the potential issues in the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our research, we only focus on “Data Analyst/Scientist” roles so our research is not representative of all positions and industries. We acknowledge that the job Data Analyst/Scientist roles might not be indicative of the company culture at large in some companies but we are including that limitation in our research question by judging the companies on the Data Analyst/Scientist job postings exclusively.\n",
    "Also, our data only includes job descriptions of companies across the United States. Hence, our findings are not applicable to geographical regions beyond the United States. \n",
