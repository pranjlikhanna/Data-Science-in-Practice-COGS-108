### Overview:
This project explores the impact of the tone used in job postings on Glassdoor and other potential factors affecting company ratings. Focusing on Data Scientist positions within medium to large-sized US companies, our team employed sentiment analysis tools to examine the correlation between the neutrality and subjectivity of job postings and company ratings. Our aim was to uncover insights that could aid job seekers in making informed decisions during their job hunting process.

### Research Question:
How do the neutrality and subjectivity of job postings for "Data Analyst" or "Data Scientist" positions on Glassdoor correlate with the company’s overall rating, for medium to large-sized US companies with 500 to 5000 employees?

### Methodology:
#### Data Collection: 
Utilized datasets from Kaggle containing information on Data Analyst and Data Scientist job postings, company ratings, and additional variables.
#### Sentiment Analysis: 
Employed Vader for neutrality analysis and TextBlob for subjectivity analysis on job descriptions.
#### Statistical Analysis: 
Conducted Pearson correlation tests, ANOVA one-way tests, and linear regression models to examine relationships between job posting tone, company ratings, and other variables.

### Key Findings:
Initial analyses suggested a weak correlation between the tone of job postings and company ratings, indicating that further nuanced analysis is necessary.
Inferential statistics revealed a positive correlation between company ratings and salary estimates, suggesting that salary may be a more significant factor in company ratings than the tone of job postings.
No statistically significant correlation was found between the neutrality or subjectivity of job postings and company ratings.

### Ethics & Privacy:
Adhered to ethical guidelines by using publicly available datasets without personal or sensitive information. Committed to preserving the privacy and integrity of the data used in our analysis.

### Limitations:
Our study focuses exclusively on "Data Analyst" or "Data Scientist" roles within the United States, potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings. Additionally, the reliance on sentiment analysis algorithms introduces potential biases.

### Future Work:
Suggestions for future research include expanding the analysis to cover a broader range of job titles and industries, as well as incorporating more diverse geographical locations.

### Usage Permission:
This project is publicly available for educational and research purposes, as specified by the team members.
