    "To job seekers, job postings provide crucial information about a job position and create the first impression of the employer. Based on the tone of the job posting, job seekers form assumptions about various aspects of the company, such as work culture, values, management, and more, helping them determine whether the position is suitable for them. Job seekers also evaluate whether a job posting aligns with their perception of the company when deciding to apply. According to a study conducted by LinkedIn, applicants are 2-4x less likely to apply for a job posting with a tone that doesn't match the company culture.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that job seekers make speculations about a company from the job posting, we wanted to use data insights to determine if there is a statistical relationship between the type of sentiment expressed in job postings and the overall satisfaction of employees working at the company. \n",
    "\n",
    "This research focuses specifically on data scientist positions, as they closely align with the interests of the research team. To collect data on job postings, we plan to use LinkedIn. For employee satisfaction ratings, we plan on using the overall company rating metric from Glassdoor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to data collection and analysis, we conducted a review of similar studies and gathered information from the past to contribute additional background knowledge to the proposed research.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar predictive study was conducted on a larger scale by Stanford University <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2), where qualitative reviews were converted into quantitative metrics and used to predict the corresponding ratings on Glassdoor. The research findings indicated that their model had a 46.4% accuracy in using the sentiment of a review to predict the ratings on a scale from 1 to 5 stars. While our study will be conducted through a different method, the conclusion from this existing study serves as a reference for our study outcome, and further comparison and analysis could be done based on both conclusions. Another study looked into factors that potentially affect job satisfaction from Glassdoor reviews. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) The study concluded that  “Culture and Values” and “Senior Management” factors have the highest influence on employees’ retention and turnover. This is valuable to our research because it indicates that sentimental syntax that implies or relates to “Culture and Values” and “Senior Management” might be more influential to the Glassdoor reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our existing knowledge and experience in analyzing job postings and the available literature, we hypothesize that within our proposed research scope, there will be a correlation between the sentiment of job postings and the overall company rating.\n",

    "Our use of the sentiment analysis algorithm embedded in Python to determine the sentiment of job postings introduces ethical considerations. The model may have biases or inaccuracies in detecting sentiments and since we cannot really know how the code in this model was written, its inaccuracies are a limitation of our research. Even though we could manually alter some critical factors in the model, it would be still worth considering the potential issues in the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our research, we only focus on “Data Scientist” roles so our research is not representative of all positions and industries. We acknowledge that the job Data Scientist roles might not be indicative of the company culture at large in some companies but we are including that limitation in our research question by judging the companies on the Data Scientist job postings exclusively.\n",
